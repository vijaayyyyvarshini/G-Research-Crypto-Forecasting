XG BOOST

XG Boost is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library that is used to solve regression, classification, and ranking problems. XGBoost is built upon supervised machine learning, decision trees, ensemble learning, and gradient boosting. With XGBoost, trees are built in parallel and not sequential. It follows a level-wise strategy, scanning across gradient values and using these partial sums to evaluate the quality of splits at every possible split in the training set. 

With XGBoost, an accuracy of
