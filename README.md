Prediction of the Cryptocurrencies using XG Boost and LSTM. 

XG BOOST

XG Boost is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library that is used to solve regression, classification, and ranking problems. XGBoost is built upon supervised machine learning, decision trees, ensemble learning, and gradient boosting. With XGBoost, trees are built in parallel and not sequential. It follows a level-wise strategy, scanning across gradient values and using these partial sums to evaluate the quality of splits at every possible split in the training set. 

LSTM

Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. LSTM's process inputs in a sequential manner, where the context from the previous input is considered when computing the output of the current step. This allows the neural network to carry information over different time steps rather than keeping all the inputs independent of each other. This algorithm is widely used for time-series generation with an accuracy of 98%. 

We had used hyperparameter tuning for both the models to increase the efficiency of how the model is used.
